# tic tac toe
i do not like react. i only have one reason for it. it's because the pattern of building UI is easier yet is farther from natural nature of JS, HTML and CSS on Web standards.

so someone who starts and sticks learning react is not learning the DNA of web.

too much of opinion thrown right at the start.

### argument

too bad some technologies are well adopted. typescript and react. this often requires others in teh community to put some learning curve to re align the thought process. just like TDD is paradigm completely different to development itself althogh both use JS, for example.

### finally

this project is simply that's mentioned on reactjs.org

trying to get comparitive paradigm in order to understand react code in the future
